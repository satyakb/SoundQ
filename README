Instructions:
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Open your extensions (Window -> Extensions)
3. Click the Developer mode box on the top right
4. Click load unpacked extension and find this unzipped folder. Highlight the folder and click open. 
5. If it isn’t enabled, enable SoundQ and test on soundcloud.com :D


Bugs:
1. Soundcloud’s player and queue player aren’t mutually exclusive
2. Orange bar on top gets covered while dragging songs

Ideas:
1. Move whole queue around page
2. 3 lines drag and drop?
3. Show more info when hover
4. Add stuff from search to queue
5. Time position/duration
6. Fully functional scrubber
7. mute/volume slider
